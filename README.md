# HealthMate

The project focuses on optimizing the user experience (UX) of a virtual healthcare platform. ​
It aims to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that caters to the diverse needs of both patients and doctors. ​
The platform will allow patients to book appointments, access doctor’s profiles, consult doctors virtually, access their medical history, receive medication reminders and seamlessly integrate health insurance information. ​
To accomplish this, I have designed a login page, signup page, support features, and efficient payment options.
